## HomelessHousingHelp
Capstone 2022

# Our Project:
Housing Voucher Help is a design-sensitive website that fills the
tech-literacy gap for the homeless community, empowering individuals to get
the resources they need. By simplifying the housing voucher application
workflow and consolidating low-income housing resources, we make applying for
and using the vouchers easier. The emergency housing voucher was implemented
to help homeless people afford rent, but a year after distribution, less than
half of them have been awarded in Seattle. Thatâ€™s why we aim to increase
voucher applications so that 100% of Seattle vouchers are utilized to connect
people with stable housing that could change their lives.
